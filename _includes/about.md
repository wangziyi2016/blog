# About Me 
Hello! I'm Ziyi, and I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of computer vision and sensor fusion technologies. With a strong foundation in both theory and practical application, I bring expertise in several key areas:

- **Programming Languages and Libraries:** Proficient in C++ and Python, I leverage libraries like PCL, OpenCV, Pybinding, Torch, and TensorFlow to develop robust applications. I'm also skilled in utilizing communication middleware such as ROS and MQTT for seamless integration.

- **Algorithms:** My experience spans real-time object detection and tracking, human 2D and 3D pose estimation, lidar 3D object detection, and low-level vision tasks like image denoising and deblurring. Additionally, I'm well-versed in lidar and camera SLAM algorithms, contributing to advancements in autonomous driving technology.

- **Experience:** As a Principal Calibration Engineer at Curium Pte Ltd, I led the development of innovative calibration algorithms for LiDAR, Radar, Camera, and IMU sensors, optimizing extrinsic parameters and reducing latency. My contributions were recognized at CES 2022 for presenting a dynamic calibration algorithm based on deep learning methods. I also have hands-on experience in deploying algorithms to customer vehicles using Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS.

- **Projects:** Some notable projects include a robust BEV object detection framework using camera data augmentation techniques, an image super-resolution and denoising algorithm based on multi-scale wavelet networks, and an endoscope video dehazing algorithm using luminance dark channel prior, all showcasing my ability to innovate and solve complex problems.

With a Master's degree in Mathematics from the National University of Singapore and a Bachelor's degree in Information and Computing Science from Zhejiang Gongshang University, coupled with several accolades including scholarships and awards, I'm committed to driving innovation and making a positive impact in the field of computer vision and sensor fusion.

I'm excited about the opportunity to collaborate on groundbreaking projects and contribute to the future of technology.
